## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small react application containing the following files:

1. **app.py:** represents the entry python file that will be executed by the computer.
2. **README.md:** contains exercise instructions.
3. **test.py:** you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.
