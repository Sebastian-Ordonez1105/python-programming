# `23` The Beatles

Who does not like The Beatles?
A BBC study has proved that 90% of kids don't know the band.. so sad.. :(

This is the chorus of one of the most famous Beatle songs:

> Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
> Whisper words of wisdom
> Let it be

## 📝 Instructions:
1. Create a function called **sing()**
2. The function needs to **print** (use the print statement and no return) a string with the exact same lyrics
you can hear from the 3:10 sec to the end of the song at 3:54 sec.
Here is the expected output:

```sh
let it be,
let it be,
let it be,
let it be,
whisper words of wisdom, let it be, let it be,
let it be,
let it be,
let it be,
there will be an answer, let it be
```

## 💡 Hint:

- The words "let it be" repeat all the time, probably you should create a loop for that.
