# `18` The Beatles

Who does not like The Beatles?

A BBC study has proved that 90% of kids don't know the band... so sad. :(

This is the chorus of one of the most famous Beatle songs:

> Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
> Whisper words of wisdom
> Let it be

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Create a function called `sing()`.

2. The function needs to **print** (use the `print` statement and not `return`) a string with the exact same lyrics. You can hear it from the sec 3:10 to the end of the song: [(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYfEBY9NM4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDYfEBY9NM4).

## 💡 Hint:

+ The words "let it be" repeat all the time, you should probably create a loop for that.

## Expected output: 

`let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, whisper words of wisdom, let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, there will be an answer, let it be`
