# `15` Your First Loop

If you run this code you'll see a count from 0 to 9 (White characters).  Fix it so that it counts up to 11, you'll see 101 on green afterwards.

### :mag_right: Important: 
There's a series of exercises dedicated to Lists and Loops, we encourage you to go and finish [those](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/python-lists-loops-programming-exercises) after this exercise. (
    
And then, come back! :smiley:).

**Can you fix it?**
