# `02` Declare Variables

In programming, we use variables like boxes (or containers) to keep different kinds of information. Here's how to create a variable:

```py
name = "Daniel"
```

In this example, `name` is the variable. We're telling the computer: "Remember `name` and let it equal `Daniel`." The name for your variable can be almost anything you want, but it must start with a letter or the underscore character (`_`). It's good to choose a name that helps you remember what you stored in the "box".

## üìù Instructions:

1. Declare a new variable with the string value "Yellow" and print the value to the console.

2. Then, print its value on the console using `print(name)`.

## üí° Hint:

+ The name of the variable can be whatever you want, but the value inside has to be the string "Yellow".
