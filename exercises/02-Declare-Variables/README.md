# `02` Declare Variables

In programming, we use variables like boxes (or containers) to keep different kinds of information. Here's how to create a variable:

```py
name = "Daniel"
```

In this example, `name` is the variable, acting like a label for the value `"Daniel"`. Think of it as a nametag on a box. Inside this 'box', we're storing the value `"Daniel"`, and we can use the label `name` to refer to it later. When naming your variables, you can choose almost any name, but it must begin with a letter or an underscore (`_`). It's helpful to pick a name that describes what's inside the 'box' so you can easily understand what it represents later on.

## üìù Instructions:

1. Declare a new variable with the string value `"Yellow"` and print the value to the console.

2. Then, print its value on the console using `print(name)`.

## üí° Hint:

+ The name of the variable can be whatever you want, but the value inside has to be the string "Yellow".
